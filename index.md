"_Of course_," she whispered. Then, she shouted: "All I need is **a little moxie**!"

---------------------------------

If you're thinking to yourself, **_This is unbelievable_**, you'd probably be right.

---------------------------------------------------

I read this interesting quote the other day:

>"Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!"
-----------------------
>Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo...

>His father told him that story: his father looked at him through a glass: he had a hairy face.

>He was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road where Betty Byrne lived: she sold lemon platt.
-----------------------
>He left her quickly, fearing that her intimacy might turn to jibing and wishing to be out of the way before she offered her ware to another, a tourist from England or a student of Trinity. Grafton Street, along which he walked, prolonged that moment of discouraged poverty. In the roadway at the head of the street a slab was set to the memory of Wolfe Tone and he remembered having been present with his father at its laying. He remembered with bitterness that scene of tawdry tribute. There were four French delegates in a brake and one, a plump smiling young man, held, wedged on a stick, a card on which were printed the words: _VIVE L'IRLANDE_!

1. Cut the cheese
  * Make sure that the cheese is cut into little triangles.

2. Slice the tomatoes
    * Be careful when holding the knife.
    * For more help on tomato slicing, see Thomas Jefferson's seminal essay _Tom Ate Those_.

We pictured the meek mild creatures where  
They dwelt in their strawy pen,  
Nor did it occur to one of us there  
To doubt they were kneeling then.

1. Crack three eggs over a bowl.

    *  Now, you're going to want to crack the eggs in such           away that you don't make a mess.

    *  If you _do_ make a mess, use a towel to clean it up!

2. Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl.

    *  Basically, take the same guidance as above: don't be     messy, but if you are, clean it up!

## Exercise 2

**Trof**

>_Troff on tekstinmuotoiluohjelmisto, joka on alun perin kehitetty AT&T:llä Unix-käyttöjärjestelmälle.
Troff- ja nroff-ohjelmat kehitti Joe Ossanna, jonka jälkeen Brian Kernighan jatkoi. Ossanna kirjoitti
alkuperäisen toteutuksen assemblyllä noin vuonna 1973 ja se kirjoitettiin uusiksi C-kielellä noin vuonna 1975.
Troffin syöttökieli on täysin ohjelmoitavissa. Taulukoiden, kaavioiden ja matemaattisten kaavojen tuottamisen
helpottamista varten on erillisiä esikääntäjiä. Troffin ohjaukseen käytetään tekstitiedostoa, jota voi muokata,
käsitellä ja säilyttää käyttäjän valitsemilla työkaluilla. Eri käyttötarkoituksia varten on kehitetty erilaisia
laajoja makropaketteja. Tyypillinen troff-toteutus sisältää me-makrot tieteellisten tutkimusjulkaisujen
tuottamista varten, man-makrot Unixin manuaalisivujen tuottamiseen sekä ms- ja mm-makrot kirjeitä, kirjoja,
muistioita ja raportteja varten._

**Scribe**

>_Scribe is a markup language and word processing system that pioneered the use of descriptive markup. Scribe was
revolutionary when it was proposed, because it involved for the first time a clean separation of presentation and content.
Scribe was designed and developed by Brian Reid of Carnegie Mellon University. It formed the subject of his 1980 doctoral
dissertation, for which he received the Association for Computing Machinery's Grace Murray Hopper Award in 1982. Reid presented
a paper describing Scribe in the same conference session in 1981 in which Charles Goldfarb presented GML (developed in 1969),
the immediate predecessor of SGML._

## Exercise 4

```C#
public class Person{
  private string name;
  private int age;

  public Person(string initialName)
  {
    this.age = 0;
    this.name = initialName;
  }
  public void PrintPerson()
  {
    Console.WriteLine(this.name + ", age " + this.age + " years");
  }
  public void GrowOlder()
  {
    this.age = this.age + 1;
  }
}
